# Fast-Multiplication
Implement the functions using only multiplication to give the answers of following:
For any floating-point number x in the range [1.00001, 1.1] using 80-bit (long double) representation,
1. Find out the largest positive integer N such that xN does not cause overflow. 
2. For any positive integer N = 2^H*3^I*5^J*7^K with non-negative H, I, J, and K,compute xN.


test cases will be given in the file, take input as file
